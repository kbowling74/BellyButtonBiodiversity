# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This dashboard was created to visualize data about volunteers for the Improbable Beef company. Volunteers 
submitted a sample of bacteria from their bellybuttons to Improbable Beef to help in finding a potential 
new meat substitute. The data accessible from this dashboard is anonymous and only identifiable from the test subject
ID number.<br>
Metadata such as age, location, and gender are attached and viewable after a selection is made. To make a selection,
simply choose an ID number from the drop down menu on the right side of the page. Once a selection is made the page automatically updates and the charts are populated with new information.<br>

A gauge visualizing the weekly washing frequency of the bellybutton by volunteer is located in the middle of the page.
The number indicates the number of times the volunteered reported washing their bellybutton within a week's period. <br>
